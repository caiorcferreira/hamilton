# Contributing to Hamilton

## Documentation Conventions

When making changes to Hamilton's own codebase, keep the documentation in `docs/`
synchronized. Every code change that affects user-facing behavior, APIs, configuration,
or CLI commands must include corresponding documentation updates.

### Mapping Code to Docs

| Code change area | Doc to update |
|------------------|---------------|
| New/changed CLI command, flag, or argument | `docs/skills.md` (setup reference) |
| New/changed artifact template in `bundle/templates/` | `docs/sdd-framework.md` |
| New/changed wayfinder artifact template in `bundle/templates/wayfinder/` | `docs/skills.md` |
| New/changed map artifacts in `.hamilton/maps/` | `docs/skills.md` |
| New/changed guideline in `bundle/guidelines/` | `docs/tutorials/custom-guidelines.md` |
| Changes to what `hamilton setup` installs | `docs/modes.md` or `README.md` |

### Rules

1. **Documentation is not optional.** A code change is incomplete until the relevant docs are updated.
2. **Match the real behavior.** Documentation must reflect the actual code, not aspirations.
3. **Use the existing format.** Tables, code blocks, and section structures in each doc file are consistent -- follow them.
4. **Update the README.** If a change affects the quick-start flow or what the CLI does, update `README.md`.
5. **No stale content.** When deprecating or removing a feature, remove its documentation in the same changeset. Do not leave `(deprecated)` notes -- cut cleanly.

## Licensing and attribution

Hamilton is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. When a skill directory is forked from another project, the skill directory — not the repo — is what users install. This means the upstream licence notice must travel inside the skill directory itself. Every forked skill directory therefore ships a sibling `NOTICE` file, and its `SKILL.md` carries a one-line provenance pointer naming the upstream skill, its licence, and that `NOTICE`.

The licence text must appear in the sibling `NOTICE` rather than in `references/`, which in this repo means content the agent is expected to read and bring into context on every skill invocation. The same text must not be repeated in the `SKILL.md` body, which is a context cost paid on every skill load.

### Per-skill NOTICE template

When forking a skill, create a `NOTICE` file in the skill directory by copying the template below, substituting the upstream skill and project names, and placing it at `skills/<skill>/NOTICE`:

```
This skill is adapted from the "<upstream skill name>" skill in
<upstream project> (<upstream project URL>), used under the MIT License.

## Map mechanics

This section is the file-native frontmatter contract for map artifacts under `.hamilton/maps/`. It is the swappable surface a future tracker backend replaces: the backend swaps this section together with the `## Map mechanics` section in `skills/hamilton-wayfinder/SKILL.md`, and no other content in this file needs to change.

| Frontmatter field | Valid values |
|-------------------|--------------|
| `type` (ticket) | `research` / `prototype` / `grilling` / `task` |
| `status` (ticket) | `open` / `claimed` / `resolved` |
| `status` (map) | `open` / `cleared` / `shipping` / `shipped` |
| `blocked_by` | YAML list of ticket numbers: `[]` for none, `[01]` for one, `[01, 04, 06, 09]` for several |

Ticket frontmatter is `type`, `status`, `blocked_by`, in that order. `map.md` carries `status` only — no `type` — matching the map template. The map lifecycle is `cleared` → `shipping` → `shipped` once the route is written (ticket 06's three-stage lifecycle, superseding ticket 04's `open`/`cleared` for maps).
