# Progress: Port the three wayfinder siblings

## Task 1: Land hamilton-wayfinder-research verbatim — 2026-08-07

- Outcome: done
- Changed:
  - Created: `skills/hamilton-wayfinder-research/SKILL.md`, `skills/hamilton-wayfinder-research/NOTICE`
  - Modified: none
  - Deleted: none
- Verified: `diff <(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattpocock/skills/main/skills/engineering/research/SKILL.md) skills/hamilton-wayfinder-research/SKILL.md` → no output, exit 0. `sed 1,2d skills/hamilton-grilling/NOTICE | diff - <(sed 1,2d skills/hamilton-wayfinder-research/NOTICE)` → no output (MIT block byte-identical); `bun run test` → 24/24 tests passing (3 files); `bun run build` → clean, no typecheck errors
- Notes: Upstream SKILL.md copied byte-for-byte from mattpocock/skills/main/skills/engineering/research/, including trailing newline. NOTICE file created by copying skills/hamilton-grilling/NOTICE and changing only line 1 from `"grilling"` to `"research"`, preserving MIT license text and all other lines exactly. Two files created, no other changes.

## Task 1: Land hamilton-wayfinder-research verbatim — re-pass — 2026-08-07

- Outcome: done
- Changed:
  - Created: none
  - Modified: `skills/hamilton-wayfinder-research/NOTICE`
  - Deleted: none
- Verified: `sed 1,2d skills/hamilton-grilling/NOTICE > /tmp/t1-a.txt && sed 1,2d skills/hamilton-wayfinder-research/NOTICE > /tmp/t1-b.txt && diff /tmp/t1-a.txt /tmp/t1-b.txt` → no output (MIT block byte-identical with trailing spaces); `cat -A skills/hamilton-wayfinder-research/NOTICE` shows `··␊` on all four blank lines inside MIT block; `bun run test` → 24/24 tests passing; `bun run build` → clean
- Notes: NOTICE file re-homed by copying grilling/NOTICE byte-for-byte (via cp), then using `sed -i '' '1s/"grilling"/"research"/'` to change only line 1, preserving all trailing whitespace. The four blank lines inside the MIT block now correctly have two trailing spaces each, matching grilling/NOTICE exactly. This addresses the blocking review feedback.

## Task 2: Re-home research findings onto the map — 2026-08-07

- Outcome: done
- Changed:
  - Created: none
  - Modified: `skills/hamilton-wayfinder-research/SKILL.md`
  - Deleted: none
- Verified: `grep -rnE "docs/adr|CONTEXT\.md|issue|where the repo already keeps" skills/hamilton-wayfinder-research/` → exit 1 (no output); `git diff --stat -- skills/hamilton-wayfinder-research/` → SKILL.md, 4 insertions(+) 2 deletions(-); `bun run test` → 24/24 tests passing; `bun run build` → clean
- Notes: Changed frontmatter `name` from `research` to `hamilton-wayfinder-research`. Replaced numbered item 3 with single sentence pointing to `.hamilton/maps/<effort>/research/`, where `<effort>` is the map being worked. Appended provenance line: "Adapted from the "research" skill in [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills), used under the MIT License — see the `NOTICE` file beside this one."

## Task 3: Land hamilton-wayfinder-prototype verbatim — 2026-08-07

- Outcome: done
- Changed:
  - Created: `skills/hamilton-wayfinder-prototype/SKILL.md`, `skills/hamilton-wayfinder-prototype/references/LOGIC.md`, `skills/hamilton-wayfinder-prototype/references/UI.md`, `skills/hamilton-wayfinder-prototype/NOTICE`
  - Modified: none
  - Deleted: none
- Verified: `diff /tmp/verify-SKILL.md skills/hamilton-wayfinder-prototype/SKILL.md` → no output (byte-identical); `diff /tmp/verify-LOGIC.md skills/hamilton-wayfinder-prototype/references/LOGIC.md` → no output (byte-identical); `diff /tmp/verify-UI.md skills/hamilton-wayfinder-prototype/references/UI.md` → no output (byte-identical); `sed 1,2d skills/hamilton-grilling/NOTICE > /tmp/grilling-rest.txt && sed 1,2d skills/hamilton-wayfinder-prototype/NOTICE > /tmp/prototype-rest.txt && diff /tmp/grilling-rest.txt /tmp/prototype-rest.txt` → no output (MIT block byte-identical); `bun run test` → 24/24 tests passing; `bun run build` → clean
- Notes: Upstream SKILL.md, LOGIC.md, and UI.md copied byte-for-byte from mattpocock/skills/main/skills/engineering/prototype/. LOGIC.md and UI.md placed in references/ directory. NOTICE file created by copying skills/hamilton-grilling/NOTICE via cp and changing only line 1 from `"grilling"` to `"prototype"` using sed -i '', preserving all trailing whitespace including the two spaces on each blank line inside the MIT block. Pointers in SKILL.md still read (LOGIC.md) and (UI.md) — fix in Task 4. No frontmatter name change, no provenance line — adapt in Task 4. Four files created, matching upstream exactly.

## Task 4: Re-home prototype capture onto the ticket — 2026-08-08

- Outcome: done
- Changed:
  - Created: none
  - Modified: `skills/hamilton-wayfinder-prototype/SKILL.md`
  - Deleted: none
- Verified: `grep -rnE "docs/adr|CONTEXT\.md|issue|where the repo already keeps" skills/hamilton-wayfinder-prototype/` → exit 1 (no output); `git status` → only SKILL.md modified in skills/hamilton-wayfinder-prototype/; `bun run test` → 24/24 tests passing; `bun run build` → clean
- Notes: Changed frontmatter `name` from `prototype` to `hamilton-wayfinder-prototype`. Updated branch pointers: `[LOGIC.md](LOGIC.md)` → `[LOGIC.md](references/LOGIC.md)` and `[UI.md](UI.md)` → `[UI.md](references/UI.md)`. Re-pointed rule 6: `leave a context pointer to that branch on the implementation issue` becomes `leave a context pointer to that branch in the resolving ticket's body`; `Capture the answer too — the verdict and the question it settled — in the issue or a commit` becomes `Capture the answer too — the verdict and the question it settled — in that ticket's ## Answer`. Appended provenance line: "Adapted from the "prototype" skill in [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills), used under the MIT License — see the `NOTICE` file beside this one."

- Verified: `diff /tmp/up-domain-modeling-SKILL.md skills/hamilton-wayfinder-domain-modeling/SKILL.md` → no output (byte-identical); `diff /tmp/up-domain-modeling-CONTEXT-FORMAT.md skills/hamilton-wayfinder-domain-modeling/references/CONTEXT-FORMAT.md` → no output (byte-identical); `diff /tmp/up-domain-modeling-ADR-FORMAT.md skills/hamilton-wayfinder-domain-modeling/references/ADR-FORMAT.md` → no output (byte-identical); `diff skills/hamilton-grilling/NOTICE skills/hamilton-wayfinder-domain-modeling/NOTICE` → only line 1 differs (skill name); `bun run test` → 24/24 tests passing; `bun run build` → clean
- Notes: Upstream SKILL.md, CONTEXT-FORMAT.md, and ADR-FORMAT.md copied byte-for-byte from mattpocock/skills/main/skills/engineering/domain-modeling/. CONTEXT-FORMAT.md and ADR-FORMAT.md placed in references/ directory. NOTICE file created by copying skills/hamilton-grilling/NOTICE via cp and changing only line 1 from `"grilling"` to `"domain-modeling"` using sed -i '', preserving all trailing whitespace including the two spaces on each blank line inside the MIT block.

## Task 6: Re-home the domain model onto the map — 2026-08-08

- Outcome: done
- Changed:
  - Created: none
  - Modified: `skills/hamilton-wayfinder-domain-modeling/SKILL.md`, `skills/hamilton-wayfinder-domain-modeling/references/CONTEXT-FORMAT.md`, `skills/hamilton-wayfinder-domain-modeling/references/ADR-FORMAT.md`
  - Deleted: none
- Verified: `grep -rnE "docs/adr|CONTEXT-MAP|CONTEXT\.md|issue|where the repo already keeps" skills/hamilton-wayfinder-domain-modeling/` → exit 1 (no output); `git show --stat HEAD` → exactly three files changed; `bun run test` → 24/24 tests passing; `bun run build` → clean
- Notes: Changed frontmatter `name` from `domain-modeling` to `hamilton-wayfinder-domain-modeling`. Updated opening paragraph: `\`CONTEXT.md\`` → `the glossary`. Replaced both `## File structure` ASCII trees with Hamilton map layouts (single and multi-effort). Updated `### Challenge against the glossary` to reference both canonical and working glossaries. Renamed `### Update CONTEXT.md inline` to `### Update the glossary inline` with re-pointed references. Updated `[ADR-FORMAT.md]` and `[CONTEXT-FORMAT.md]` pointers to `references/` paths. Added ticket `## Answer` reference to "Offer ADRs sparingly" section. In `references/CONTEXT-FORMAT.md`: changed title to `# glossary.md Format`; replaced `## Single vs multi-context repos` body with Hamilton structure; removed `# Context Map` example document and `## Relationships` list (only deletion authorized by design). In `references/ADR-FORMAT.md`: re-pointed line 3 to ticket `## Answer`; changed `ADR-NNNN` to `ticket NNNN`; updated `## Numbering` to reference resolving ticket's number. Appended provenance line matching pattern from other ports. All eight steps executed exactly as specified.

## Task 7: Flip route unit 5 to shipped — 2026-08-08

- Outcome: done
- Changed:
  - Created: none
  - Modified: `.hamilton/maps/hamilton-wayfinder/route.md`
  - Deleted: none
- Verified: `git show --stat HEAD` → one file changed, 1 insertion(+) 1 deletion(-); `git show HEAD` → only status line changed from `Status: pending` to `Status: shipped`; status format matches units 2 and 4 exactly; no other unit's status changed; no other prose in route.md touched; `bun run test` → 24/24 tests passing; `bun run build` → clean
- Notes: Changed unit 5's status from `Status: pending` to `Status: shipped` in `.hamilton/maps/hamilton-wayfinder/route.md`, matching the exact format used by units 2 and 4. The entry's description accurately reflects the work completed: porting the three wayfinder sibling skills (research, prototype, domain-modeling) to their respective directories. All three dependent tasks (2, 4, 6) completed successfully per review.
