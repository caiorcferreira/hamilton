# Code Feedback: Task 21 — Synchronize per-pass evidence specifications and verification

## Pass 1 — 2026-09-17

Base: 37ca30abafcd6cc407961629ab136bf79033a22c
Head: 3b514fcf0807643e9dc2b77886533e59449d77b6
Verdict: changes-requested

### Blocking

- [tests/cli/workbench.test.ts:448] The valid multi-pass branch never asserts `preconditionValid.status` or a positive feedback/review gate result, so it would still pass if precondition consumed Pass 1 (`changes-requested`) and returned a closed gate for non-approval; assert status `0` (and/or the explicit approved feedback/review gate output) to prove precondition uses Pass 2. (violates: Task 21 acceptance that lint, context, and precondition agree on the physically latest evidence)

### Suggestions

- None.
