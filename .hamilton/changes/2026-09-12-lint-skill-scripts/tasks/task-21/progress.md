# Task Progress: Task 21 — Synchronize per-pass evidence specifications and verification

## Attempt 1 — 2026-09-17

Outcome: done

Created:
- none

Modified:
- `.hamilton/specs/artifact-templates.md`
- `.hamilton/specs/review.md`
- `.hamilton/specs/workbench.md`
- `docs/sdd-framework.md`
- `docs/skills.md`
- `tests/cli/workbench.test.ts`
- `.hamilton/changes/2026-09-12-lint-skill-scripts/progress.md`

Deleted:
- none

Verification:
- `bun --bun vitest run tests/cli/workbench.test.ts` — passed, 12 tests
- `bun --bun vitest run` — passed, 362 tests
- `bun run build` — passed
- `git diff --check` — passed
- `bun --bun vitest run tests/cli/workbench.test.ts && bun --bun vitest run && bun run build && git diff --check` — passed

Notes:
- Added end-to-end CLI coverage for requested-change, approved, and malformed physical-last feedback and review passes across lint, context, and precondition.
- Synchronized canonical specifications and framework documentation with per-pass `Base`, `Head`, and `Verdict`, single-file append-only ownership, no numbered feedback or review files, and bounded one-pass global-frontmatter compatibility.
- Generalized the whole-change package-path assertion for the platform-specific temporary-directory root.
- No production implementation files were modified. `PR-44-STATE.md` and the Task 21 `.base` checkpoint were preserved.

## Attempt 2 — 2026-09-17

Outcome: done

Created:
- none

Modified:
- `tests/cli/workbench.test.ts`
- `.hamilton/changes/2026-09-12-lint-skill-scripts/progress.md`

Deleted:
- none

Verification:
- `bun --bun vitest run tests/cli/workbench.test.ts` — passed, 12 tests
- `bun --bun vitest run` — passed, 362 tests
- `bun run build` — passed
- `git diff --check` — passed
- `bun --bun vitest run tests/cli/workbench.test.ts && bun --bun vitest run && bun run build && git diff --check` — passed

Notes:
- Added the focused `preconditionValid.status` assertion so the valid multi-pass branch requires an open precondition gate and therefore consumes Pass 2 approved evidence rather than Pass 1 changes-requested evidence.
- Preserved the existing Pass 1, Pass 2, malformed Pass 3 fixtures and CLI output assertions; corrected only the synthetic task-attempt field and evidence commit boundaries needed to satisfy the existing precondition contract.
- The first focused run after adding the assertion exposed those fixture-contract gaps and returned `gate: closed (3 failing)`; the corrected fixture passed all final verification.
- No production implementation files, canonical documentation, `plan.md`, `feedback.md`, sibling evidence, `PR-44-STATE.md`, or the immutable Task 21 `.base` checkpoint were modified.
