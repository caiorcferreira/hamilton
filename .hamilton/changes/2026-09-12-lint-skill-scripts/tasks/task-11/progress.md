# Task Progress: Task 11 — Compose the workbench CLI

## Attempt 1 — 2026-09-13

- Outcome: done
- Created:
  - `src/cli/commands/workbench.ts`
  - `tests/cli/workbench.test.ts`
- Modified:
  - `src/cli/main.ts`
- Deleted: none
- Verification:
  - `~/.hamilton/scripts/hamilton-isolate.sh --check --change-dir .hamilton/changes/2026-09-12-lint-skill-scripts/` — passed; isolated: yes
  - `bun --bun vitest run tests/cli/workbench.test.ts && bun run build` — passed; 10 tests passed and TypeScript build succeeded
  - `bun --bun vitest run && bun run build` — passed; 24 files and 677 tests passed and TypeScript build succeeded
  - `git diff --check` — passed
- Notes: Added the namespaced Effect CLI, operation-specific parsing and validation, production runtime composition, result rendering, and subprocess coverage without relying on installed helper scripts or a source checkout in the command working directory. No deviations or residual concerns.
