# Task Progress: Task 3 — Validate artifact bodies and workflow records

## Attempt 1 — 2026-09-12

- Outcome: done
- Created: none
- Modified:
  - `src/workbench/artifact-contracts.ts`
  - `tests/workbench/artifact-contracts.test.ts`
  - `.hamilton/changes/2026-09-12-lint-skill-scripts/progress.md`
  - `.hamilton/changes/2026-09-12-lint-skill-scripts/tasks/task-3/progress.md`
- Deleted: none
- Verification:
  - `bun --bun vitest run tests/workbench/artifact-contracts.test.ts` — passed, 27 tests.
  - `bun run build` — passed.
  - `bun run test` — passed, 570 tests across 17 files.
  - `git diff --check` — passed.
- Notes: Added comment-aware heading views, contract-specific body structure checks, workflow record extraction for ledgers, passes, attempts, outcomes, and units, contiguous numbering diagnostics, physical-last-pass state, and legacy-unsupported classification. No checkbox-list validation was added.

## Attempt 2 — 2026-09-12

- Outcome: done
- Created: none
- Modified:
  - `src/workbench/artifact-contracts.ts`
  - `tests/workbench/artifact-contracts.test.ts`
  - `.hamilton/changes/2026-09-12-lint-skill-scripts/progress.md`
  - `.hamilton/changes/2026-09-12-lint-skill-scripts/tasks/task-3/progress.md`
- Deleted: none
- Verification:
  - `bun --bun vitest run tests/workbench/artifact-contracts.test.ts && bun run build` — passed, 27 tests; TypeScript build passed.
  - `bun run test && bun run build` — passed, 570 tests across 17 files; TypeScript build passed.
  - `git diff --check` — passed.
- Notes: Reconciled task-owned completion drift already present after the prior implementation commit. The source and test changes were formatting-only, were preserved, and retained all Task 3 behavior. No checkbox-list validation was added; the stable `.base` checkpoint was preserved.

## Attempt 3 — 2026-09-12

- Outcome: done
- Created: none
- Modified:
  - `src/workbench/artifact-contracts.ts`
  - `tests/workbench/artifact-contracts.test.ts`
  - `.hamilton/changes/2026-09-12-lint-skill-scripts/progress.md`
  - `.hamilton/changes/2026-09-12-lint-skill-scripts/tasks/task-3/progress.md`
- Deleted: none
- Verification:
  - `bun --bun vitest run tests/workbench/artifact-contracts.test.ts && bun run build` — passed, 28 tests; TypeScript build passed.
  - `bun run test && bun run build` — passed, 571 tests across 17 files; TypeScript build passed.
  - `git diff --check` — passed.
- Notes: Added contract-specific plan and progress task-ledger extraction with location-bearing malformed and non-monotonic diagnostics. Anchored append-only record headings to reject trailing text and added regression coverage. The stable `.base` checkpoint was preserved.
