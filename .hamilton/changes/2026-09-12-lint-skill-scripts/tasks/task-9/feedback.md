# Code Feedback: Task 9 — Port repository precondition gates

## Pass 1 — 2026-09-13

### Blocking

- [src/workbench/precondition.ts:58-113] The precondition module re-creates the production process, filesystem, and Git adapters instead of consuming the shared runtime adapter from `src/workbench/runtime.ts`. This duplicates concrete IO wiring and bypasses the design's composition-boundary/runtime-seam decision, allowing the adapters to drift; move production adapter composition into the shared runtime layer and keep this module on its injected, role-sized ports (violates: design Architecture & Components and Task 9 step 2).
- [tests/workbench/precondition.test.ts:106-166] The required missing-command/command-environment failure case is absent: the suite covers a command that exits nonzero and a successful injected command, but does not prove that an unavailable or throwing command closes the gate without success. Add the missing repository fixture or injected failure case and assert its exact non-success result and output (violates: Task 9 step 1 and the acceptance criterion for command/environment failures).

### Suggestions

- None.
