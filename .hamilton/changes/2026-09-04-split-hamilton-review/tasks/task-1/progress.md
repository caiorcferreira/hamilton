# Task Progress: Task 1 — Parse split change context

## Task 1: Parse split change context — 2026-09-04

- Outcome: done
- Changed: created none; modified `bundle/scripts/hamilton-change-context.sh`, `tests/scripts/change-context.test.ts`; deleted none
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run tests/scripts/change-context.test.ts` → 19 tests passed
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run` → 104 tests passed
- Verified: `bun run build` → passed
- Notes: Validates the split task ledger and inventories pre-plan and legacy directories without deriving legacy state.

- Outcome: done
- Changed: created none; modified `bundle/scripts/hamilton-change-context.sh`, `tests/scripts/change-context.test.ts`; deleted none
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run tests/scripts/change-context.test.ts` → 20 tests passed
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run` → 105 tests passed
- Verified: `bun run build` → passed
- Notes: Recovery self-review made physical latest task evidence authoritative by clearing any earlier outcome when a newer attempt begins; direct and `--all` output were inspected, including GNU/Linux modification-time ordering.

- Outcome: done
- Changed: created none; modified `bundle/scripts/hamilton-change-context.sh`, `tests/scripts/change-context.test.ts`; deleted none
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run tests/scripts/change-context.test.ts` → 24 tests passed
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run` → 109 tests passed
- Verified: `bun run build` → passed
- Notes: Addressed review feedback by rejecting mixed root task history as legacy in direct and inventory modes, rejecting sibling task attempt identities, and preserving an empty ledger for all-abandoned plans. The original scaffold checkpoint remains unchanged.

- Changed: created none; modified `bundle/scripts/hamilton-change-context.sh`, `tests/scripts/change-context.test.ts`; deleted none
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run tests/scripts/change-context.test.ts` → 28 tests passed
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run` → 113 tests passed
- Verified: `bun run build` → passed
- Notes: Completed mixed-root validation by accepting only the root progress heading and Task/Status/Progress table shape; direct and inventory regressions reject task, review, and finish history after a valid table. The original scaffold checkpoint remains unchanged.

- Outcome: done
- Changed: created none; modified `bundle/scripts/hamilton-change-context.sh`, `tests/scripts/change-context.test.ts`; deleted none
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run tests/scripts/change-context.test.ts` → 35 tests passed
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run` → 120 tests passed
- Verified: `bun run build` → passed
- Notes: Rejected task-scoped passes in root review without deriving standing, rejected repeated root tables, made every task-progress H2 an authoritative validated attempt boundary, and replaced Bash 4 line collection with Bash 3-compatible scalar streams and redirected reads. Direct and inventory regressions cover each reviewed case; the original scaffold checkpoint remains unchanged.

- Outcome: done
- Changed: created none; modified `bundle/scripts/hamilton-change-context.sh`, `tests/scripts/change-context.test.ts`; deleted none
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run tests/scripts/change-context.test.ts` → 45 tests passed
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run` → 130 tests passed
- Verified: `bun run build` → passed
- Notes: Made all physical task-progress headings authoritative, rejected wrong-level and non-attempt boundaries plus stray outcomes, and required exactly one `done | blocked` outcome for every completed attempt regardless of root row status. Direct and inventory regressions cover wrong-level, stray, missing, duplicate, and illegal evidence; the original scaffold checkpoint remains unchanged.

- Outcome: done
- Changed: created none; modified `bundle/scripts/hamilton-change-context.sh`, `tests/scripts/change-context.test.ts`; deleted none
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run tests/scripts/change-context.test.ts` → 51 tests passed
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run` → 136 tests passed
- Verified: `bun run build` → passed
- Notes: Normalized Markdown ATX boundaries with zero to three leading spaces for task evidence and root task-review classification, and centralized a three-or-more-hyphen table-separator grammar across both root parsers. Direct and inventory regressions cover indented malformed evidence, indented legacy review passes, and short separators; the original scaffold checkpoint remains unchanged.

- Outcome: done
- Changed: created none; modified `bundle/scripts/hamilton-change-context.sh`, `tests/scripts/change-context.test.ts`; deleted none
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run tests/scripts/change-context.test.ts` → 63 tests passed
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run` → 148 tests passed
- Verified: `bun run build` → passed
- Notes: Recognized every one-to-six-marker ATX boundary after zero to three spaces, including empty and tab-delimited H2s, while preserving four-space code indentation; made root table rows one contiguous block terminated by the first blank while retaining trailing blanks for a zero-row all-abandoned ledger. Direct and inventory regressions cover all reviewed cases; the original scaffold checkpoint remains unchanged.

## Task 1: Parse split change context — 2026-09-04

- Outcome: done
- Changed: created none; modified `bundle/scripts/hamilton-change-context.sh`, `tests/scripts/change-context.test.ts`; deleted none
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run tests/scripts/change-context.test.ts` → 67 tests passed
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run` → 152 tests passed
- Verified: `bun run build` → passed
- Notes: Moved exact task-file H1 validation into the ATX-aware task parser, required exactly one matching level-one heading before attempt sections, and removed the generic artifact-header helper as task identity proof. Direct and inventory regressions reject seven-marker and no-space pseudo-headings; shell syntax, diff hygiene, Bash 3 portability, and the original scaffold checkpoint were also verified.
