# Task Progress: Task 14 — Publish the split workflow migration guidance

## Attempt 1 — 2026-09-04

- Outcome: done
- Changed:
  - Created: none
  - Modified: `README.md`, `docs/skills.md`, `docs/sdd-framework.md`, `docs/modes.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  - Deleted: none
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run && bun run build && git diff --check` → passed; 15 test files and 325 tests passed, TypeScript build succeeded, and the diff had no whitespace errors
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run` → passed; 15 test files and 325 tests passed
- Verified: `bun run build` → passed; TypeScript build succeeded
- Verified: documentation acceptance and stale-language searches outside historical artifacts → passed
- Notes: Read all five documents end to end and self-reviewed them against every acceptance criterion. The installed diff-package helper predates task-scoped checkpoints, so the repository's current bundled helper recorded the required Task 14 base at `d219109496cd47a840a1039886cbc59855812f47`; no implementation deviation or remaining concern.
