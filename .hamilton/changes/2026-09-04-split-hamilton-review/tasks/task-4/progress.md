## Task 4: Scope diff checkpoints to individual tasks — 2026-09-04
- Outcome: done
- Changed: modified `bundle/scripts/hamilton-diff-package.sh`, `tests/scripts/diff-package.test.ts`, `progress.md`
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run tests/scripts/diff-package.test.ts` → 18 tests passed; `bun run test` → 164 tests passed; `bun run build` → passed
- Notes: Task checkpoints are recorded once at `tasks/task-N/.base`; explicit-base and whole-change packaging remain covered.

- Outcome: done
- Changed: modified `bundle/scripts/hamilton-diff-package.sh`, `tests/scripts/diff-package.test.ts`, `progress.md`
- Verified: `bun --bun vitest run tests/scripts/diff-package.test.ts` → 20 tests passed; `bun run test` → 166 tests passed; `bun run build` → passed
- Notes: Addressed review feedback by rejecting abandoned task headings and non-canonical persisted task checkpoints without changing the original orchestration checkpoint.
