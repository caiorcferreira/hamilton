# Code Feedback: Task 4 — Scope diff checkpoints to individual tasks

## Pass 1 — 2026-09-04

Base: b12631cb679e714a6bb6329d730ca2dfd8460263
Head: d5327a9cd92f2af2416393ddbef1ba9ee88bde2a
Verdict: approved

### Blocking

- None.

### Suggestions

- None. Verified exact active-task validation, ignored task-local checkpoints, record-once correction ranges, task isolation, fail-closed checkpoint errors without `HEAD~1`, and retained explicit-base and whole-change behavior; the focused suite passes all 20 tests.

## Pass 2 — 2026-09-05

Base: b12631cb679e714a6bb6329d730ca2dfd8460263
Head: 3764c25c14aaaee1dcda7ba3b58ca36d5ceaa690
Verdict: approved

### Blocking

- None.

### Suggestions

- None. Verified the approved forward-only bootstrap normalization: Task 4 retains two attempts in physical order as canonical, contiguous `Attempt 1` and `Attempt 2` headings, with both original dates and every evidence-body line preserved. The task-local checkpoint behavior remains covered by all 20 focused tests.
