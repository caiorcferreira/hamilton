- Verification:
  - `bun --bun vitest run tests/skills/orchestrate-contract.test.ts tests/skills/review-contract.test.ts` — test-first run failed in the expected six new durable-approval contract assertions before implementation.
  - `bun --bun vitest run tests/skills/orchestrate-contract.test.ts tests/skills/review-contract.test.ts` — passed, 44 tests across 2 files.
  - `bun --bun vitest run --reporter=dot` — passed, 502 tests across 15 files.
  - `bun run build` — passed.
  - `git diff --check` — passed.
- Notes: Orchestration and direct whole-branch review now consume an approval only when the exact feedback path is tracked and unchanged at current HEAD, its latest touching commit is artifact-only, and its physical last pass is valid, approved, blocking-free, and fresh. Orchestration recomputes that predicate at state load, after feedback handoff, before a later task checkpoint, and before whole-branch review; non-durable approval routes back to code feedback.
