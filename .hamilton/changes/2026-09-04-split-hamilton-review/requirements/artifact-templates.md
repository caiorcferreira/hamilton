# Capability: artifact-templates

Every artifact shape Hamilton produces is defined once in the bundled templates tree and installed under `~/.hamilton/templates/`; this change separates current task status, task execution history, task feedback, whole-branch review, and finish history into shapes with unambiguous owners.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Task execution details have an installed template and nested instance path

The bundled templates tree SHALL contain `task-progress.md`, and `hamilton setup` SHALL install it as `~/.hamilton/templates/task-progress.md` and report the relative name `task-progress.md`. `hamilton-plan` SHALL initialize each instance at `.hamilton/changes/<change>/tasks/task-N/progress.md`, where `task-N` is the lowercase hyphenated encoding of the exact plan identifier `Task N`. The artifact SHALL identify that task in a `# Task Progress: Task N — <title>` heading and provide an append-only shape for dated implementation attempts with `done` or `blocked` outcome, changed paths, verification evidence, and notes.

- Priority: must
- Rationale: task-local execution evidence needs a different shape from the root current-state index even though both instances are named `progress.md` in their owning directories.

#### Scenario: Setup installs the task progress shape

- WHEN the bundle contains `bundle/templates/task-progress.md` and `hamilton setup` completes
- THEN `~/.hamilton/templates/task-progress.md` matches the bundled content and the setup result includes `task-progress.md`

#### Scenario: Planning initializes Task 12

- WHEN `hamilton-plan` finalizes `Task 12`
- THEN it creates `.hamilton/changes/<change>/tasks/task-12/progress.md` from the installed task-progress shape

#### Scenario: A task receives another implementation attempt

- WHEN a later code attempt completes for the same task
- THEN the new dated attempt is appended to that task's existing `progress.md` and earlier attempts remain unchanged

### Requirement: Task feedback has its own installed template and nested instance path

The bundled templates tree SHALL contain `feedback.md`, and `hamilton setup` SHALL install it as `~/.hamilton/templates/feedback.md` and report the relative name `feedback.md`. `hamilton-code-feedback` SHALL create each instance at `.hamilton/changes/<change>/tasks/task-N/feedback.md`, using the same exact task-directory mapping as task progress. The artifact SHALL identify that task in a `# Code Feedback: Task N — <title>` heading, retain append-only dated passes, record the exact full commit identifiers on `Base:` and `Head:` lines in each pass, express the verdict on a `Verdict:` line as `approved` or `changes-requested`, and separate Blocking findings from Suggestions.

- Priority: must
- Rationale: a dedicated shape and task-owned location remove scope inference from a mixed change-level file while preserving Hamilton's directory-as-manifest installation model.

#### Scenario: Setup installs the feedback shape

- WHEN the bundle contains `bundle/templates/feedback.md` and `hamilton setup` completes
- THEN `~/.hamilton/templates/feedback.md` matches the bundled content and the setup result includes `feedback.md`

#### Scenario: Task 12 receives its first feedback pass

- WHEN `hamilton-code-feedback` reviews `Task 12` for a change
- THEN it creates or appends `.hamilton/changes/<change>/tasks/task-12/feedback.md` from the installed feedback shape

#### Scenario: A task is re-reviewed

- WHEN a later feedback pass is recorded for the same plan task
- THEN the new dated pass is appended to that task's existing `feedback.md` and earlier passes remain unchanged

#### Scenario: A feedback pass identifies its code revision

- WHEN code feedback records a pass for a task diff
- THEN the pass includes the full base and head commit identifiers from that diff package so a helper can determine whether later task code made the verdict stale

#### Scenario: A nested artifact is copied to another task directory

- WHEN a task progress or feedback heading declares `Task 2` but the file is under `tasks/task-3/`
- THEN deterministic consumers treat the artifact as malformed rather than attributing Task 2 evidence or approval to Task 3

### Requirement: Finish history has an installed change-level template

The bundled templates tree SHALL contain `finish.md`, and `hamilton setup` SHALL install it as `~/.hamilton/templates/finish.md` and report the relative name `finish.md`. `hamilton-finish-work` SHALL instantiate it at `.hamilton/changes/<change>/finish.md` as append-only change-level history using paired `## Attempt N — <date>` and `## Outcome N — <date>` sections with the same monotonic positive integer. Attempt sections SHALL carry passed preconditions, specification synchronization, strategy, intended workspace result, and route intent; outcome sections SHALL carry `Result: completed | blocked`, verified external result, actual workspace and route state, and blockers or partial state. The shape SHALL support a temporarily dangling attempt when execution is interrupted between the two sections.

- Priority: must
- Rationale: finish history has a change-level lifecycle and external evidence that belongs neither in the task index nor in whole-branch review.

#### Scenario: Setup installs the finish shape

- WHEN the bundle contains `bundle/templates/finish.md` and `hamilton setup` completes
- THEN `~/.hamilton/templates/finish.md` matches the bundled content and the setup result includes `finish.md`

#### Scenario: Finish records a verified result

- WHEN `hamilton-finish-work` completes or blocks after beginning a finish strategy
- THEN it appends paired, equally numbered attempt and observed-outcome sections to `.hamilton/changes/<change>/finish.md` without adding a finish section to root progress

#### Scenario: Finish is interrupted after its attempt record

- WHEN `Attempt 2` is present without `Outcome 2`
- THEN the artifact unambiguously identifies one unfinished finish operation for resume to reconcile before allocating another attempt number

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The bundle is the only repository template source

Every artifact shape in the repository SHALL have exactly one authoritative definition under `bundle/templates/`, and `hamilton setup` SHALL install that tree to the user-level `~/.hamilton/templates/` destination. The repository SHALL NOT retain or consult a project-local `.hamilton/templates/` mirror. Existing tracked files under `.hamilton/templates/` SHALL be removed in this change rather than updated alongside the bundle; project change, specification, and map artifacts under `.hamilton/` SHALL remain untouched.

- Priority: must
- Rationale: the tracked project-local copies predate the bundled installation model, have already diverged, and force every template change to choose between drift and duplicate maintenance.

#### Scenario: Contributor changes an artifact shape

- WHEN a contributor updates a template used by Hamilton
- THEN the shape is changed once under `bundle/templates/` and no corresponding `.hamilton/templates/` file exists to update

#### Scenario: Setup installs templates

- WHEN `hamilton setup` runs from the repository bundle
- THEN it copies `bundle/templates/` into `~/.hamilton/templates/` without reading a project-local `.hamilton/templates/` directory

#### Scenario: Legacy project-local templates are removed

- WHEN this change is implemented
- THEN tracked `.hamilton/templates/` files are deleted while `.hamilton/changes/`, `.hamilton/specs/`, and `.hamilton/maps/` remain intact

### Requirement: Progress template represents the root task index only

The bundled `progress.md` template SHALL define the task-only index instantiated at `.hamilton/changes/<change>/progress.md`. Its body SHALL be a Markdown table with exactly the columns Task, Status, and Progress; each Task cell SHALL use `Task N: <Markdown-escaped title>`; its allowed status vocabulary SHALL be `pending`, `in-progress`, `blocked`, and `done`; and each Progress cell SHALL hold a Markdown link targeting the exact relative path `tasks/task-N/progress.md`. The shape SHALL contain no task attempt block and no review or finish section. `hamilton setup` SHALL continue installing and reporting `progress.md` at the templates root.

- Priority: must
- Rationale: the existing root filename remains the familiar resume entry point while its compact shape becomes an index and authoritative current-state ledger.

#### Scenario: Planner instantiates root progress

- WHEN a plan contains Task 1 and Task 2
- THEN the root artifact contains two plan-ordered pending rows whose links point to `tasks/task-1/progress.md` and `tasks/task-2/progress.md`

#### Scenario: A task attempt completes

- WHEN `hamilton-code` completes Task 1
- THEN it changes Task 1's Status cell and records details in the linked task file without appending an attempt section to root progress

### Requirement: Review template represents whole-branch review only

The bundled `review.md` template SHALL define the append-only whole-branch review artifact created at `.hamilton/changes/<change>/review.md`. Its scope SHALL be fixed to the complete branch rather than parameterized as `Task N` or `whole change`, and each dated pass SHALL record the exact full merge-base and head commit identifiers on `Base:` and `Head:` lines, express `approved` or `changes-requested` on a `Verdict:` line, and separate Blocking findings from Suggestions. `hamilton setup` SHALL continue installing and reporting `review.md` at the templates root.

- Priority: must
- Rationale: once task feedback owns its own artifact, the change-level review shape can state one scope without a machine-classified placeholder.

#### Scenario: Whole branch receives its first review pass

- WHEN `hamilton-review` reviews the complete branch for a change
- THEN it creates or appends `.hamilton/changes/<change>/review.md` from the installed whole-branch review shape

#### Scenario: Task feedback is being recorded

- WHEN `hamilton-code-feedback` records a verdict for `Task 4`
- THEN it does not write a task section into `.hamilton/changes/<change>/review.md`

### Requirement: Template documentation presents all split execution and review artifacts

The template catalog and artifact layout SHALL distinguish root `progress.md` as the task index produced by `hamilton-plan` and updated by `hamilton-code`; `task-progress.md` as the Task Progress shape instantiated at `tasks/task-N/progress.md`; `feedback.md` as the Task Feedback shape instantiated at `tasks/task-N/feedback.md`; `review.md` as Whole-branch Review at the change root; and `finish.md` as Finish History at the change root. Template source filenames SHALL remain root-level even when their live instances are nested by task.

- Priority: must
- Rationale: the installed source path identifies the reusable shape, while the per-change instance path communicates lifecycle ownership; readers need both to apply the contract correctly.

#### Scenario: Reader inspects the template catalog

- WHEN a reader opens the bundled templates README or framework artifact layout
- THEN they can distinguish each source template, producer or updater, and instance path without inferring ownership from another document

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Root progress stores append-only task attempts and stage summaries

- Reason: detailed task attempts move to `tasks/task-N/progress.md`, review owns `review.md`, feedback owns `feedback.md`, and finish owns `finish.md`; retaining any of them at root would recreate a mixed stream.
- Migration: use root progress only for current task rows and follow each row's link for implementation evidence on changes started with the new artifact generation.

### Requirement: One review template serves task and whole-change scopes

- Reason: a parameterized scope in one `review.md` shape enables the ambiguity this change removes and conflicts with task-owned feedback artifacts.
- Migration: install the complete new template and skill set between changes; use `feedback.md` for new task feedback and the narrowed `review.md` for new whole-branch review.
