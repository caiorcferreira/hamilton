# Finish History: Replace Effect-TS in the CLI with NestJS

## Attempt 1 — 2026-09-27

- Passed preconditions: Gate open at `4f8b4fc26c17f9b0ab46f7b6a67c941169009328` on branch `wt/refacto-effect-to-nest-worktree-20260925`, with a clean tree in `/home/caio/.local/share/pi-worktrees/20260925181958/refacto-effect-to-nest-worktree-20260925`. Base `origin/main` was `7a940c09efc36c19e9109185b68c4ad2ab833edf`; latest material change was `64ee98375ea8e5f62ceee314175ac181aaf16679`. Whole-branch Review Pass 3 was approved with zero blocking findings, Base `7a940c09efc36c19e9109185b68c4ad2ab833edf`, Head `2f29e1a3e5cf490e26ce5791fc26da8da4bee9b9`. All 25 tasks had fresh approved feedback. The branch-local v0.9.0 source CLI precondition passed; `bun --bun vitest run` passed 540 tests across 41 files and `bun run build` passed. The installed v0.8.10 CLI initially misread the historical outcome fields for Tasks 14 and 23; the source CLI gate passed after Task 25 added scoped compatibility. No ancestry waiver was used.
- Specification synchronization: Signed commit `ee2a4ef4da71c5b88efad06d31c1e4926519e25e` updates only `.hamilton/specs/cli-distribution.md` and `.hamilton/specs/workbench.md` from the approved proposal, design, and requirement deltas. Both specs passed targeted workbench lint; the commit signature verified. This was the only post-gate commit.
- Strategy: pull request
- Intended workspace result: Push `wt/refacto-effect-to-nest-worktree-20260925` to `origin`, open a pull request against `main`, and leave the branch and linked worktree at `/home/caio/.local/share/pi-worktrees/20260925181958/refacto-effect-to-nest-worktree-20260925` in place with a clean tree. Do not merge or remove the worktree.
- Route intent: none; `route_unit` is `null` and no route or map mutation is required.
