# Task Progress: Task 25 — Read legacy task outcome fields

## Attempt 1 — 2026-09-27

- Outcome: done
- Created: none
- Modified: `src/workbench/artifact-body.ts`, `tests/workbench/precondition.test.ts`, `.hamilton/changes/2026-09-25-replace-effect-cli-with-nestjs/progress.md`, `.hamilton/changes/2026-09-25-replace-effect-cli-with-nestjs/tasks/task-25/progress.md`
- Deleted: none

### Preflight

- `hamilton workbench isolate --check --change-dir .hamilton/changes/2026-09-25-replace-effect-cli-with-nestjs` passed with `isolated: yes`.
- `hamilton workbench diff --record --task 25 --change-dir .hamilton/changes/2026-09-25-replace-effect-cli-with-nestjs` recorded checkpoint `c7274934f19b94bf860110e5d6f3967ed4a345ed`; the commit resolves and is an ancestor of current HEAD.

### Red

- Added committed-fixture coverage for exact unbulleted `Outcome: done` plus missing, non-done, empty, and malformed values; the existing committed modern `- Outcome: done` fixture remains covered.
- First focused run: `bun --bun vitest run tests/workbench/precondition.test.ts` exited 1 with five failures. The historical case showed the intended gate failure; four negative cases failed only because the test expected an exact `gate: closed` line while the result appended `(1 failing)`. Changed that assertion to check the stable `gate: closed` prefix.
- Red rerun: `bun --bun vitest run tests/workbench/precondition.test.ts` exited 1 with only the historical success case failing (`Task 1 latest attempt is not done`); 37 tests passed, including the modern success and all negative cases.

### Green

- Restricted legacy field extraction to `task-progress` `attempt` records while preserving the existing bulleted parser.
- `bun --bun vitest run tests/workbench/precondition.test.ts` passed: 38 tests.

### Refactor

- `bun --bun vitest run tests/workbench/precondition.test.ts && bun --bun vitest run && bun run build` exited 0: focused suite 38/38; full suite 539/539 across 41 files; build passed (`tsc -p tsconfig.json`).
- `git diff --check` passed.
- `hamilton workbench lint --file .hamilton/changes/2026-09-25-replace-effect-cli-with-nestjs/tasks/task-25/progress.md` passed for the pending scaffold before implementation and passed again after final evidence was added.
- `hamilton workbench lint --file .hamilton/changes/2026-09-25-replace-effect-cli-with-nestjs/progress.md` passed after setting Task 25 to `done`.

- Notes: Stable checkpoint is `c7274934f19b94bf860110e5d6f3967ed4a345ed` in the ignored Task 25 `.base`. No changes were made to other tasks, task histories, feedback, specifications, or version files.
