# Code Feedback: Task 25 — Read legacy task outcome fields

## Pass 1 — 2026-09-27

Base: c7274934f19b94bf860110e5d6f3967ed4a345ed
Head: 260c932178d1ea2207fbbee928b41a72b28ff7ca
Verdict: changes-requested

### Blocking

- [src/workbench/artifact-body.ts:278] The compatibility regex accepts `Outcome:done` as `done`, although Task 25 permits only the exact historical `Outcome: done` field and malformed fields must keep the gate closed. Require the historical field separator and add a committed negative case for this malformed form (violates: Task 25 Acceptance).
- [.hamilton/changes/2026-09-25-replace-effect-cli-with-nestjs/progress.md:106,137] Task 25 remains `pending` in the root progress frontmatter ledger while its synchronized task row and task-progress status are `done`. The existing precondition contract rejects this metadata/row mismatch, so the committed evidence leaves the task gate closed. Synchronize the root metadata status with the completed task evidence (violates: committed task-evidence gate; `.hamilton/specs/workbench.md` Invariants).

### Suggestions

- None.
