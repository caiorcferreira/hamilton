# Code Feedback: Task 11 — Register Nest setup command

## Pass 1 — 2026-09-26

Base: 10b2b7deac6bf1526619d65cc136c5627207d703
Head: d7fecdfd0d7c2b6e66707ae36998ef30cd8a88e8
Verdict: changes-requested

### Blocking

- [src/cli/nest/setup.command.ts:42-46] The successful setup output reports only `result.templates` and never reports the installed guidelines; the success test likewise asserts only templates. This does not satisfy the fresh/existing setup scenario requiring both templates and guidelines to be reported. Include guideline reporting in the success output and assert it in the command test (violates: `cli-distribution` — `Setup assets and failure status`, `Fresh or existing setup`).

### Suggestions

- None.
