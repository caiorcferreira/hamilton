# Code Feedback: Task 16 — Register prototype subcommand

## Pass 1 — 2026-09-26

Base: 67c13edbbd4ce5ec1f1bac6da03587a23a3be6c4
Head: 264941ab46f41fc2cd2dc49020b8b68f878a5675
Verdict: changes-requested

### Blocking

- [tests/cli/prototype-command.test.ts:160-202] The command's service-invocation cases all return `exitCode: 1`; the success-shaped default is only used by the help case, which never invokes the service. Add a successful service-result case that asserts `exitCode: 0` and exact stdout/stderr passthrough, retaining the existing negative-result assertions (violates: Task 16's cited workbench command contract, which requires preserving both success `0` and normal-negative `1` result codes and streams).

### Suggestions

- None.
