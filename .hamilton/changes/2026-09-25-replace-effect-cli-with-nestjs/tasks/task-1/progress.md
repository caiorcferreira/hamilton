# Task Progress: Task 1 — Pin Nest runtime and compiler support

## Attempt 1 — 2026-09-25

- Outcome: done
- Created:
  - `tests/cli/nest-metadata.test.ts`
- Modified:
  - `package.json`
  - `bun.lock`
  - `tsconfig.json`
  - `.hamilton/changes/2026-09-25-replace-effect-cli-with-nestjs/progress.md` (Task 1 status only)
  - `.hamilton/changes/2026-09-25-replace-effect-cli-with-nestjs/tasks/task-1/progress.md`
- Deleted: none
- Verification:
  - `hamilton workbench isolate --check --change-dir .hamilton/changes/2026-09-25-replace-effect-cli-with-nestjs/` — passed; `isolated: yes`.
  - Checkpoint validation (`git cat-file -e` and `git merge-base --is-ancestor` for `01fbd58a835e3d7363bb3d5967aa37f2d5ed7bb5`) — passed; full commit resolves and is current `HEAD`'s ancestor.
  - Pre-install `bun --bun vitest run tests/cli/nest-metadata.test.ts` — failed before test collection because Vitest rejected decorators; no behavior assertion ran.
  - Pre-install `bun -e 'import("nest-commander")'` — failed with `Cannot find package 'nest-commander'`; records the missing-dependency Red alternative, not a behavior assertion.
  - `bun install` — passed and regenerated `bun.lock`; emitted incorrect peer dependency warnings for Nest 12.1.0.
  - Post-install `bun --bun vitest run tests/cli/nest-metadata.test.ts` — passed, 1 test.
  - `bun --bun vitest run` — passed, 29 files and 479 tests.
  - `bun run build` — passed.
  - Post-install `bun -e 'import("nest-commander")'` — passed.
  - `git diff --check` — passed.
- Notes: The approved dependency pins were retained and Effect packages remain. Enabling `experimentalDecorators` and `emitDecoratorMetadata` in `tsconfig.json` was sufficient; no Vitest configuration change was needed. The install peer warnings were not accompanied by runtime, test, or build failures. The existing `.base` checkpoint was preserved unchanged.
