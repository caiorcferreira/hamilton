# Code Feedback: Task 5 — Synchronize the artifact and framework documentation

## Pass 1 — 2026-09-23

Base: eea9031d21b53d9a7e1c34dc0a5f0ab29ea2e425
Head: ee1f0a92f497b5a82973141813b76e9035d70b06
Verdict: changes-requested

### Blocking

- [.hamilton/specs/artifact-templates.md:64] The canonical documentation says new artifacts record configured Git attribution and preserves an author only when revising a plan, but it does not document the required name-and-email construction, the ask-or-stop behavior when either configured value is missing, or preservation for edits to existing author-bearing artifacts generally — state those behaviors from the cited author-attribution requirement (violates: Populate artifact authors from configured Git identity; Task 5 acceptance for configured attribution and preservation)

### Suggestions

- [.hamilton/specs/workbench.md:5] Consider updating `updated` to `2026-09-23` because this body changed in the reviewed range; the existing value is lint-valid and no explicit task requirement makes this a blocking defect.
