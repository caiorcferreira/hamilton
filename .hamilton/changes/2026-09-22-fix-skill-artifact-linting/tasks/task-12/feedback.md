# Code Feedback: Task 12 — Synchronize renamed task titles across re-plan artifacts

## Pass 1 — 2026-09-23

Base: 410a97224f5c0dc3382a173498a0ebeb27cb972a
Head: 1a2a098b0d96fae321110cf7b06182d29cb4b05d
Verdict: changes-requested

### Blocking

- [tests/skills/execution-contracts.test.ts:44-45] The new skill-contract assertions do not explicitly require the renamed title in the active `plan.md` task heading: both regexes can still pass if `active plan heading` is removed, because they only require the exact title to be followed by root frontmatter and the task-progress heading. Add an assertion that directly covers the active plan heading representation while retaining the other identity, status, path, link, and append-only history checks (violates: Task 12 acceptance requiring a skill-contract regression for all four renamed representations).

### Suggestions

- None.
