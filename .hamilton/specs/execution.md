# Capability: execution

## Overview

Hamilton's execution state separates current task standing from detailed implementation evidence. Planning creates a task ledger and task-owned logs, code owns one task's transitions, orchestration resumes from the ledger plus review freshness, and finish-work records its own verified lifecycle without turning progress into a mixed timeline.

## Contract

### Task ledger and evidence

The root `<change>/progress.md` is a Markdown table with exactly the columns `Task`, `Status`, and `Progress`. It has one row for each active plan task, in plan order. Each row identifies the task as `Task N: <title>`, uses one of `pending`, `in-progress`, `blocked`, or `done`, and links to `tasks/task-N/progress.md`. The task directory is derived from the numeric identifier, not the title.

Each `tasks/task-N/progress.md` identifies exactly one task and contains append-only implementation attempts. A canonical attempt is numbered in physical order and records its `done` or `blocked` outcome, changed paths, verification evidence, and relevant notes or concerns. The task log contains no sibling execution, feedback, whole-branch review, or finish history.

Before a task's first implementation attempt, its ignored `tasks/task-N/.base` records the full current commit identifier. That checkpoint is reused for every feedback package for the task, including corrections; whole-branch review derives its range from the default-branch merge base.

### Finish history

The change-level `finish.md` contains paired `Attempt N` and `Outcome N` sections. An attempt records passed gates, specification synchronization, strategy, intended workspace result, and route intent. Its matching outcome records `completed` or `blocked`, the verified external result, actual workspace and route state, and any partial state or blocker. A temporarily unmatched attempt identifies one finish operation awaiting reconciliation.

## Behavior

Planning initializes the complete task structure for active tasks, preserving exact numeric identities and escaping titles for the Markdown table. Re-planning preserves done tasks, existing directories, and append-only histories; it adds new active tasks as pending, may rename a non-done display title, and removes abandoned tasks from the active ledger without deleting their history or reusing their identifiers.

Code starts one identified task by moving only its row to `in-progress`. A completed implementation appends the task-local attempt and changes the same row to `done` or `blocked`; a correction can reopen a prior `done` or `blocked` task. An interrupted run leaves `in-progress` as an explicit signal for inspection. A blocked run persists its task evidence and status without committing partial production edits.

Resume uses the root row as current implementation truth and the task-local log as evidence. Pending or blocked tasks need implementation handling; an in-progress task needs inspection of its current git and log state; a done task without fresh feedback needs feedback; a done task with fresh changes requested needs correction; and only a done task with fresh approved feedback advances. Missing or malformed checkpoints stop packaging rather than guessing a base.

Finish-work records its intent only after all preconditions and specification synchronization pass. It verifies the external strategy and workspace state before appending the matching outcome. A dangling attempt is reconciled against git, remote, request, route, and workspace state before any new attempt number is allocated.

Planned changes using the old mixed review or monolithic progress layout are inventoried as unsupported historical format rather than interpreted. A directory without `plan.md` remains a valid pre-plan state.

**Examples**

- finalize a plan with Tasks 1–3 -> root progress has three pending rows in order and three matching task logs
- start Task 2 -> only Task 2 moves to `in-progress`, and its checkpoint records the current full commit
- complete then correct Task 2 -> its log retains both attempts, the checkpoint stays fixed, and the row returns through `in-progress` to its latest outcome
- resume with Task 2 done but feedback missing or stale -> code feedback is requested for Task 2 rather than repeating implementation
- re-plan after abandoning Task 2 and appending Task 4 -> Task 2's files remain, Task 4 is pending with a new log, and identifiers are not reused
- finish action is interrupted after `Attempt 2` -> the same attempt is reconciled and receives `Outcome 2` or safely continues before any new attempt
- context inventory encounters a planned old-format change -> it labels the directory `legacy-unsupported` without deriving task status from old sections

## Invariants

- Root progress MUST contain exactly the active plan tasks once, in order, with exact task links and allowed statuses.
- A `done` row MUST have matching latest task evidence with `Outcome: done`; the ledger and evidence MUST NOT disagree.
- Every task checkpoint MUST remain stable across retries and corrections and MUST NOT be inferred from a guessed parent commit.
- Task logs, feedback, review, and finish history MUST remain owned by their respective artifacts; root progress MUST NEVER contain their timelines or summaries.
- Finish history MUST use paired, monotonic attempt and outcome numbers, and finish-work MUST NEVER claim an external or workspace result before reading it back.
- New execution MUST NEVER interpret, migrate, or silently accept a planned legacy layout.

## Decisions

- **The root ledger is current state, not history.** A compact index gives every driver one deterministic resume surface while detailed evidence remains next to the task that produced it.
- **Numeric task identity is stable.** Titles can change while work is replanned; deriving paths from `Task N` prevents collisions and preserves history.
- **Checkpoints belong to tasks.** A task's feedback range must survive later tasks and correction passes, so one shared mutable change base is insufficient.
- **Finish intent and observation are separate.** An external action cannot be honestly described until it is read back, so the attempt and outcome are paired but persisted at different moments.
- **Unsupported history is visible, not interpreted.** A between-changes migration keeps new producers strict and lets global inventory report old work without inventing current state.
