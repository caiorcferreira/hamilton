# Spec altitude reference

A rubric for the **altitude** and **shape** of a canonical spec
(`.hamilton/specs/<capability>.md`) — the level of abstraction at which it states what a
capability guarantees, and the human-readable form it takes. It governs two producers of
canonical specs:

- **distillation** — `hamilton-finish-work` folding a change's structured requirement deltas
  into the canonical spec.
- **direct authoring** — `hamilton-compose-spec` reformatting an existing spec, or writing one
  from the application code.

It does **not** govern the change artifacts themselves.

**Change artifacts may be as specific as they need to be.** A `requirements/` delta, a
`design.md`, a `plan.md` — these describe one particular change and can name concrete mechanism,
exact signatures, and even code when that is the clearest way to pin the work down. They keep
the structured `SHALL` + `WHEN`/`THEN` form. Do not lift or strip them.

**The canonical spec is different.** It is the project's durable body of knowledge — the
contracts, behaviors, invariants, decisions, and learnings that outlive any single change. It is
read by everyone who touches the capability next, so it is written **at altitude** and it **reads
like documentation a human wrote**, not like a compliance form. A canonical spec pinned to
mechanism becomes false on the next refactor and stops being usable as shared knowledge; a
canonical spec buried in `SHALL`/`WHEN`/`THEN` scaffolding stops being read at all.

## The shape: a light universal skeleton

Every canonical spec uses the same five top-level sections. They are the four registers below
plus a narrative frame. Prose and tables under each; **omit any section a capability has nothing
for** — right-sized, not gold-plated.

```markdown
# Capability: <name>

## Overview
<One paragraph: what this capability is responsible for, in plain prose.>

## Contract
<The concrete interface a consumer touches: field tables, schemas, endpoints,
 request/response shapes, status codes, error taxonomy. This is where a data-model
 spec shows field names and types, and an endpoint spec shows its routes.>

## Behavior
<Narrative input->output prose, including edge and error paths.>

**Examples**
- <input / trigger> -> <observable outcome>
- <input / trigger> -> <observable outcome>

## Invariants
- <A property that holds across all states and over time.>

## Decisions
- <A reusable design rule or deliberate decision future work must follow.>
```

Write the canonical spec in **flowing prose** — let paragraphs run as continuous lines; break
only at real boundaries (paragraphs, list items, headings). Do not hard-wrap at a fixed width.

**Anchors.** The five section headings, plus any domain subheadings you add under Contract or
Behavior (e.g. `### RAP_OPERATION_SYNC`, `### POST /events`), are the **merge anchors**. A change
is folded in by locating the section or subsection its behavior belongs to and updating it — not
by matching a `Requirement:` name. Keep subheadings stable and named for the durable thing they
describe (an event type, an endpoint, a config group), so the next change can find them.

## Register → section mapping

Everything in a canonical spec is one of four registers. If a sentence is none of them, it does
not belong. Each register has a home section:

| Register | Section | Holds |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Contract** | `## Contract` | the interface to consumers: endpoints, request/response shapes, status codes, persisted schema, field names and types, error taxonomy. |
| **Behavior** | `## Behavior` (+ **Examples**) | observable input → output, including edge and error paths. |
| **Invariant** | `## Invariants` | a property that holds across all states and over time. |
| **Decision / pattern** | `## Decisions` | a *reusable* design rule or deliberate decision, stated so future work follows it. Where the "learnings and decisions" from `design.md` land — distilled to the rule, not the instance. |
| (narrative frame) | `## Overview` | one paragraph orienting the reader to what the capability is. |

## The altitude test

Applies to every statement you are about to write into the canonical spec. A statement is at the
right altitude when it would **survive a reasonable reimplementation**: rewrite the feature in
another language, with different names and control flow, keeping the observable behavior — the
statement is still true.

Three litmus checks, sharpest first:

1. **Black-box scenario.** Each behavior should be observable through inputs and outputs. If a
   statement could only be verified by inspecting source, an AST, or call structure, it is too
   low. You cannot black-box-test "uses a `switch`." You can black-box-test "not-found → 404."
2. **The "via / using / as" tell.** A clause like "… via a `BeforeCreate` hook", "… using a
   `switch`", "… as a `json.RawMessage`" almost always names a HOW. Cut the clause; keep the WHAT.
3. **Reason to change.** If the statement would change for a reason no consumer of the contract
   would care about — an internal rename, a control-flow cleanup, a library swap — it is too low.

## The Examples block: scenarios, distilled

The change-side deltas carry `WHEN`/`THEN` scenarios — proto-conformance tests. In the canonical
spec that scaffolding reads robotic, but the *information* is worth keeping. Fold each surviving
scenario into a compact **Examples** bullet under `## Behavior`, as an input → outcome pair:

- `WHEN a required environment variable is not set / THEN the parser errors and the service exits`
  becomes `- unset required var (e.g. APP_QUEUE_URL) -> parser errors, exit at startup`.

Keep only the examples that state durable, black-box behavior; drop those that were really
restating mechanism. The block stays greppable, so a test-writer or reviewer can still enumerate
the capability's conformance points — without a `#### Scenario:` heading in sight.

## Voice

Write the canonical spec as plain technical documentation. Reserve the normative keywords
`MUST` / `NEVER` for the `## Invariants` section and hard boundaries, where the emphasis earns
its keep. Elsewhere, natural declarative prose ("The controller routes by type without re-parsing
the payload") says the same thing and reads better. (The change-side deltas keep `SHALL`
regardless — this voice guidance is for the canonical spec only.)

## The decision/pattern register: policy, not incident

This register most easily drifts low. Record a design detail in `## Decisions` **only** if it is a
reusable rule or a decision that constrains future work in more than one place. Test: *"is this a
policy, or an incident?"*

- **Policy (keep, as a rule):** "HTTP handlers depend on a narrow consumer-defined interface,
  never the concrete store." "DB errors are translated to domain sentinels at the repository
  boundary." These recur; a new call site should obey them. Draw them from `design.md`'s
  Decisions.
- **Incident (drop):** "`handleUpdate` uses a `switch`." "The store wraps `*gorm.DB`." True at
  exactly one call site; constrains nothing else. This is where mechanism leaks in.

When you keep a pattern, state the **rule**, not the **occurrence**: "error-to-status mapping
happens at the HTTP boundary via typed sentinels" — not "`handleUpdate` matches `ErrX` and `ErrY`."

Cross-cutting idioms (naming, DI style, error mapping) belong once in a project guideline and are
referenced, not restated in every capability spec. A capability spec states a pattern only when
that capability is where the pattern is established.

## A canonical spec MUST NOT contain

- Control-flow choices (`switch`/`if`, loop shape, early-return style).
- Names of internal/private structs or constructor/factory signatures, or their field lists —
  *unless the fields are the consumer-facing contract* (a persisted schema, a request/response
  body, an event payload), in which case they belong in `## Contract` as a field table.
- Library mechanics (ORM hooks, specific SDK calls) — state the **effect**, not the call.
- File paths or package layout **as requirements**. (Fine as an informative aside; a requirement
  anchored to a path is false the day the file moves.)
- Anything whose behavior could only be verified by reading the source.

(All of the above are legitimate in the change's `requirements/`, `design.md`, or `plan.md` —
they just do not survive the distillation into the canonical spec.)

## Before → after

A change's `requirements/` delta legitimately said, in structured form:

> ### Requirement: Remediation job database table
> … The `id` column SHALL be generated as a UUID v4 on insert via a GORM `BeforeCreate` hook.
> The `status` column SHALL be constrained to PENDING/COMPLETED/FAILED …
>
> #### Scenario: New job persisted
> - WHEN a job is created
> - THEN its id is a server-assigned UUID and its status is PENDING

Distilled into the canonical spec — keep the contract and invariant, drop the mechanism, land it
in the skeleton:

> ## Contract
> A remediation job persists with a server-assigned UUID `id`, a `status` of
> PENDING / COMPLETED / FAILED, and its operation payload.
>
> ## Behavior
> A new job is created in PENDING and moves to COMPLETED or FAILED as it resolves.
>
> **Examples**
> - create a job -> id is a server-assigned UUID, status PENDING
>
> ## Invariants
> - `status` MUST be one of PENDING / COMPLETED / FAILED.
> - Adding a field to a job's payload MUST NOT require a schema migration.

The `BeforeCreate` hook, the column types, and the GORM mechanics stay behind in `design.md` and
the code.

And a "requirement" that was really a review nit —

> ### Requirement: Error handling in handleUpdate
> The `handleUpdate` method SHALL use a `switch` statement … to return 404 / 400.

— does not enter the canonical spec at all: the behavior ("unknown id → 404") is already the
endpoint's contract in its `## Contract` / `## Behavior`, and the `switch` is mechanism.
