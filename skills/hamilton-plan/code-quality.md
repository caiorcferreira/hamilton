# Code quality reference

A self-review rubric for **design and planning altitude** — the point where code
quality is actually decided. The structure a design commits to, and the way a plan slices
and sketches the work, are inherited by every line the coder later writes. A weak coder
executing steps verbatim cannot invent quality that the design and plan did not encode, and
catching a structural defect at review means paying to refactor code that already exists.
Fix it here instead.

## How to use this

- During self-review, walk each principle and check the artifact (`design.md`, or a
  `plan.md` task and its snippets) for the **smell** — a trigger you can actually observe in
  the text, not a vibe. If it trips, apply the **fix** before clearing the gate.
- **Scale scrutiny to the change.** A mechanical or one-file change trips few of these; a
  new subsystem trips many. Proportionality is itself a quality principle — do not gold-plate
  a small change to satisfy a checklist. When in doubt, spend the scrutiny on decomposition
  and boundaries, which are the expensive things to get wrong.
- **The vocabulary is paradigm-neutral.** "A unit" means a module, class, or function,
  whichever your target codebase uses. SOLID is included because it translates cleanly across
  paradigms — read "depends on an abstraction" as an interface, a passed function, or an
  injected effect, as the code demands.

## Principles

Each entry is *principle · smell (what it looks like in a design or plan) · fix*.

### Single responsibility (cohesion)
A unit has one reason to change. **Smell:** you cannot state a component's responsibility
without "and" or a bulleted list; one plan task bundles unrelated changes. **Fix:** split
along the axes that change independently — one component, one task, per reason to change.

### Low coupling / clear boundaries
Units depend on as little of each other as possible, through narrow interfaces. **Smell:** a
component reaches into another's internals; a boundary passes a concrete, mutable data
structure through; a described change ripples across many modules. **Fix:** define a narrow
interface and hide what is behind it, so internals can change without breaking consumers.

### Dependency inversion & testable seams
High-level policy depends on abstractions, not concrete details, and every unit has a seam
where a test can substitute its collaborators. **Smell:** core logic names a concrete
IO/DB/clock/network/randomness source directly; a plan task describes behavior that can only
be exercised with real IO. **Fix:** inject the dependency behind an interface or parameter,
and name the seam in the design so the plan can test against it.

### Open for extension
Adding a case does not mean editing the branching of the existing one. **Smell:** a design
that grows a new `switch`/`if`-arm per type; "to add X you edit function Y." **Fix:**
polymorphism, a lookup table, or a registry so new cases are additive.

### Substitutability
Every variant honors the contract its callers rely on; no caller needs to know which variant
it holds. **Smell:** an implementation that throws on or silently no-ops part of the
interface; callers that type-check the concrete variant before acting. **Fix:** rethink the
hierarchy, or narrow the interface to what all variants truly share.

### Interface segregation
A client depends only on what it uses. **Smell:** a fat interface whose implementers stub
half its methods; a component pulled into depending on a large module for one function.
**Fix:** split into role-specific interfaces sized to each client.

### DRY / single source of truth
Each piece of knowledge — a rule, a constant, a shape — has one authoritative definition.
**Smell:** the same logic or value appears in two design components or two plan tasks;
parallel structures that must be changed together to stay correct. **Fix:** name it once and
reference it. **Counter:** do not merge things that are only incidentally alike today; that
couples them for no reason.

### Right-sized abstraction (YAGNI)
Structure matches real, present need — and no more. **Smell:** a layer, generic, config knob,
or extension point with exactly one caller and no requirement asking for a second.
**Fix:** cut it; add the seam when the second case actually arrives. This is the counterweight
to every principle above — apply them to remove concrete pain, never to speculate.

### Intention-revealing names
Names state purpose, and units where relevant. **Smell:** `data`, `manager`, `helper`,
`process()`, boolean flags whose meaning you must trace the code to recover. **Fix:** rename
to the domain concept the reader is looking for.

### Explicit error and edge handling
Failure modes are designed, not incidental. **Smell:** a design with only a happy path; a
plan task whose acceptance criteria never mention an error or edge case; errors that get
swallowed or flattened into strings. **Fix:** enumerate failure → expected behavior, and turn
each into a testable acceptance criterion.

### Complexity budget
Prefer the simplest structure that solves the actual problem; watch size, nesting, and
indirection. **Smell:** a planned function that will plainly outgrow a screen or nest past a
few levels; a design carrying more layers of indirection than the problem has moving parts.
**Fix:** decompose, flatten with early returns, or remove the indirection.

## The two artifacts this judges

- **`design.md`** — decomposition, boundaries, and dependencies: the structure the code
  inherits. This is the highest-leverage place to apply the rubric.
- **`plan.md`** — whether the tasks preserve that structure, keep each unit independently
  testable, and whether any code snippet in the plan itself models the clean shape rather
  than a shortcut the coder will copy.
