# Design document

Create the design document that explains HOW to implement the change. Good design docs explain the "why" behind technical decisions.

Focus on architecture and approach, not line-by-line implementation.
Reference the proposal for motivation and specs for requirements.


## Process
**1. Exploring approaches:**
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**2. Presenting the design:**
- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Scale each section to its complexity: a few sentences if straightforward, up to 200-300 words if nuanced
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

**3. Design for isolation and clarity:**
- Break the system into smaller units that each have one clear purpose, communicate through well-defined interfaces, and can be understood and tested independently
- For each unit, you should be able to answer: what does it do, how do you use it, and what does it depend on?
- Can someone understand what a unit does without reading its internals? Can you change the internals without breaking consumers? If not, the boundaries need work.
- Smaller, well-bounded units are also easier for you to work with - you reason better about code you can hold in context at once, and your edits are more reliable when files are focused. When a file grows large, that's often a signal that it's doing too much.

**4. Documentation:**
- After the user validated the approaches and sections, write the document to `.hamilton/changes/<change-id>/design.md` following the Format defined below
- Use writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available
- Commit the design document to git

**5. Design Self-Review:**
After writing the Design document, look at it with fresh eyes:
1. **Placeholder scan:** Any "TBD", "TODO", incomplete sections, or vague requirements? Fix them.
2. **Internal consistency:** Do any sections contradict each other? Does the architecture match the feature descriptions?
3. **Scope check:** Is this focused enough for a single implementation plan, or does it need decomposition?
4. **Ambiguity check:** Could any requirement be interpreted two different ways? If so, pick one and make it explicit.

Fix any issues inline. No need to re-review — just fix and move on.

**6. Approval:**
<HARD_GATE>
After the design review loop passes, ask the user to review the written spec before proceeding:

> "Design written and committed to `<path>`. Please review it and let me know if you want to make any changes before we start writing out the implementation plan."

Wait for the user's response. If they request changes, make them and re-run the spec review loop. Only proceed once the user approves.

## Format
Sections:
- **Context**: Background, current state, constraints, stakeholders
- **Goals / Non-Goals**: What this design achieves and explicitly excludes
- **Decisions**: Key technical choices with rationale (why X over Y?). Include alternatives considered for each decision.
- **Risks / Trade-offs**: Known limitations, things that could go wrong. Format: [Risk] → Mitigation
- **Migration Plan**: Steps to deploy, rollback strategy (if applicable)
- **Open Questions**: Outstanding decisions or unknowns to resolve
