<!--
  Route — the compiled outcome of a cleared Wayfinder map.
  Produced by: hamilton-wayfinder
  Lives at: .hamilton/maps/<effort>/route.md

  The body explains the destination and the causal path chosen. Tickets hold
  detailed evidence, rejected alternatives, and decision history.

  Unit identity, lifecycle, dependencies, and backing tickets live only in
  frontmatter. Downstream processes update lifecycle metadata without rewriting
  the synthesized body.

# Route — <Effort Name>

## Point of departure

<!--
  Describe in one short paragraph, or a few bullets, what was materially unclear
  when wayfinding began. Include only ambiguity that shaped the destination.
  This is orientation, not a chronological history.
-->

## Destination

### Outcome

<!--
  State what will be true when this destination is eventually built. Describe
  the intended result, not the implementation work or the Wayfinder process.
-->

### Concrete shape

<!--
  Make the destination imaginable to an agent that did not participate in
  wayfinding. Use only the representations that remove meaningful ambiguity:
  a walkthrough, examples, process flow, state model, component view, decision
  table, or another domain-appropriate model.
-->

### Guardrails and boundaries

<!--
  State the invariants, constraints, and explicit exclusions that future
  proposals and implementations must preserve.
-->

-

### Builder latitude

<!--
  Record choices deliberately left to propose, design, or implementation because
  they cannot change the destination. Do not place unresolved product or
  architectural decisions here; those are remaining fog and require tickets.
-->

-

## Path chosen

<!--
  Synthesize the decisions that define the destination. This is a causal path,
  not meeting minutes or ticket chronology.

  Each entry states:
  1. what was chosen or ruled out;
  2. why;
  3. what consequence binds the destination;
  4. where to inspect the full evidence.

  Include rejected branches only when their rejection establishes an important
  boundary. Current truth belongs here; superseded answers remain in tickets.
-->

- **<Decision name>.** Chose <choice> because <reason>. Therefore <binding consequence>. ([<ticket title>](tickets/NN-slug.md))
- **<Boundary name>.** Ruled out <option> because <reason>. Therefore <excluded behavior or scope>. ([<ticket title>](tickets/NN-slug.md))

## Shipping rules

<!--
  Describe how downstream processes execute the units: merge-back branch,
  commit and merge/PR conventions, and shipping-relevant operation rules carried
  from the map. Wayfinder defines these rules but does not perform the work.
-->

- Merge-back branch: `<branch from map>`
- <standing shipping rule>

## Units

<!--
  Units are coarse delivery boundaries. Each unit enters the downstream process
  once. They are not implementation tasks and do not prescribe design that
  belongs in propose, design, or plan artifacts.

  The matching frontmatter entry owns the unit's id, stable name, lifecycle
  status, dependencies, and backing ticket paths.
-->

### 1. <Unit name>

**Destination contribution:** <Name the part of the destination this unit makes real.>

<!--
  In one paragraph, explain what this unit delivers, why it forms one coherent
  change, and how it advances the destination. Describe outcome and intent, not
  implementation steps.
-->

**Done when**

- <Observable outcome proving this destination facet exists>
- <Relevant boundary or failure condition that must hold>

**Binding constraints**

<!--
  Restate only the decision consequences that directly constrain this unit.
  Link to tickets for detailed reasoning and alternatives.
-->
