<!--
  Code Feedback — review history for one plan task.
  Produced by: hamilton-code-feedback (step 4).
  Lives at: .hamilton/changes/<change>/tasks/task-N/feedback.md
  Whole-branch review belongs in review.md.
  Delete this instruction block and every inline hint before finalizing.

  Fresh files use identity and lifecycle-only frontmatter with complete pass-local Base, Head, and
  Verdict fields. For the first append to a legacy-global history, validate the legacy-global history
  before one atomic mutation: preserve every existing pass body byte-for-byte, remove exactly the
  global `base`, `head`, and `verdict` fields, and append the next complete pass-local record at the
  physical end in the same mutation. Never copy global provenance into historical passes. Never retain
  global provenance beside an explicit suffix. A fieldless prefix followed by an explicit suffix is
  already transitioned; append normally to that suffix. Fail closed for partial globals, mixed
  global-plus-explicit evidence, missing legacy globals without an explicit suffix, or any fieldless
  pass after the explicit suffix. Never create feedback-<k>.md.
